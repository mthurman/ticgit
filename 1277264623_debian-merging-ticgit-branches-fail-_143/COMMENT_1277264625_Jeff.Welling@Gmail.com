When other changes are made to a ticgit repository, and then that repository is merged with your repository, the previous changes that were made to accomodate the updating of ticgit's output aren't sufficient.  This was noticed when ti list showed one set of comments, I made a comment on one of them, and when I did ti list again, the list had entirely changed to show other comments that were merged in long ago.
